# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model

This analysis is based on 

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to create a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service), and also, deploy the model on Heroku, allowing for real-time predictions.
 
### Data Source
The dataset used for this project was gotten from Kaggle. It is a telecom company's customer data. including features like gender, tenure, internet service, payment method, and churn status. 

### Tools

- Excel
- Python libraries Pandas, Scikit-learn,  etc.
- Jupyter Notebook


### Steps

The project includes several  data preprocessing, model training, and deploying. the model on Heroku, making it accessible online.


#### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The initial step was to install and import all the required python libraries/modules that are to be used in the course of the analysis, then the next step involved converting the dataset from a text file format to a CSV format. This conversion facilitated easier manipulation and analysis within Jupyter Notebook.
